# unzip-nets
A greedy approach for finding optimal architecture (in terms of speed-accuracy tradeoff) for Multi-Task Learning. Although such kind of delicate graph manipulation are easier on [PyTorch][pytorch], we chose to use [TensorFlow][tf] for its matureness on mobile platforms ([TF-Lite][lite]).

## Repository structure
This repo is divided into 3 main branches:

*  `master` - for the main Unzip-Nets Multi-Task Learning code
*  `gh-pages` - for the documentations and [literature summaries][litsum] (with LaTeX)
