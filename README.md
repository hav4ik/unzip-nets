# unzip-nets
A greedy approach for finding optimal architecture for Multi-Task Learning

## Repository structure
This repo is divided into 3 main branches:

*  master      -- for the main Unzip-Nets Multi-Task Learning code
*  gh-pages    -- for the documentations and literature summaries (with LaTeX)
*  experiments -- for messy experiments and trash code that would pile up

For literature summaries (maybe it would be benefitial for fellow scholars out there), please visit [this link](https://hav4ik.github.io/unzip-nets).
