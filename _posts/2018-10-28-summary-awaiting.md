The following papers are awesome and can inspire and shed new lights to new approaches for the Multi-Task Learning problem, but I don't have time to thoroughly read them yet:

### Multi-Task Learning:

*  Multi-Task Learning with Gradient Communication *(Awaiting review on ICLR'19)*  
   [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1e9W3AqFX) \| [PDF link](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1e9W3AqFX)
*  GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks *(ICML'18)*  
   [arxiv:1711.02257](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257) \| [PDF link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02257.pdf)

### Representation Transfer:

*  An Information-Theoretic Metric of Transferability for Task Transfer Learning *(Awaiting review on ICLR'19)*
